# PayrollExercise
This exercise is designed to create a program that relates the data in different arrays to show a Payroll Program.

Our group has been tasked with creating a program that relates data through subscripts of different arrays. The following is the exericse paragraph:
1. Payroll

Design a program that uses the following parallel arrays:

-empId: An array of seven integers to hold employee identification numbers.
         The array should be initialized with the following numbers:

         56588, 45012, 78951, 87775, 84512, 13028, 75804

-hours: An array of seven integers to hold the number of hours worked by each employee.
-payRate: An array of seven doubles to hold each employee's hourly rate.
-wages: An array f seven doubles to hold each employees gross wages
The program should relate the data in each array thorough the subscripts. For example, the number in element 0 of the hours array should be the number of hours worked by employee whose identification number is stored in element 0 of the empId array. That same employees pay rate should be stored in element 0 of the payRate array.

The program should display each employee and ask the user to enter that employee's hours and pay rate. It should then calculate the gross wages for that employee ( hours X pay rate),  which should be stored in the wages array. After the data has been entered for all employees, the program should display each employee's identification number and gross wages.
